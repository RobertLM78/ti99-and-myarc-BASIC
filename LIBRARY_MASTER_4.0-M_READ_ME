*** GENERAL INFORMATION ***
***************************
Thank you for taking a look at Library Master 4.0-M for Myarc Ext. Basic.
Library Master 4.0-M can store about 400 titles with up to 3 authors per title.
The data is stored in a file named LIBCAT, in RELATIVE,INTERNAL,FIXED 108 
format.
The most critical modification that will need to be made initially are the 
lines opening the data file.  Adjust the paths as necessary - see lines 2750, 
2790, 2910, and 2950.
NOTE for EXISTING 'LIBCAT' files from VERSION 3.x, run the FILEMOD program 
first before starting up Library Master 4.0-M.  This will modify the 0th record 
on the file and set it to the number of records on the file (in string form).
It is recommended to make a backup of the LIBCAT first, and don't forget to 
change the path names on lines 110 and 190 of the FILEMOD program. Alternatively
you can modify REC 0 yourself using Library Master 3.x to update the file, if
you have kept track of record numbers by hand as the version 3.x 'required'.

****************************
*** NEW & ADDED FEATURES ***
****************************
Library Master 4.0-M introduces a new approach, and loads the entire file into
memory in four different arrays.  This speeds things up considerably.  In 
addition to utilizing extra memory available, this new version introduces two
new functions to the program, a Title Browse and a sort to alphabetize the 
Titles. 

******************************
*** UPDATING THE DATA FILE ***
******************************
Upon selecting UPDATE DATA FILE (#2 in the L/S/U menu), you will be prompted to
enter a password.  The default password is PASSWORD (see line 3100 to change 
this).  A password is there to provide some  "protection"  from  unwanted  or 
improperly entered records.   Updating  the data file is done by establishing a
for-loop.  You then will be prompted to input the first record number to be 
entered, then the last record number to be entered (e.g. X to X for entering 
one record).  The program clears the screen and then input prompts are given for
the information about the book:

AUTHOR #1(14): 
AUTHOR #2:
AUTHOR #3:
TITLE(39): 
SUBJECT(3): 
NOTES(9): 

Where the numbers in parentheses are the maximum number of characters allowed 
per entry.  You may choose to enter just the author's last name, or last name 
and first initialÂ¹.  For more on subjects, see that section of this READ ME.  
NOTES section is a small field of 9 characters max length for additional notes.
IMPORTANT: you cannot enter more than one title of the same name in the file, 
and will be prompted to enter a different title if a duplicate is found. 
IMPORTANT NOTE: unlike version 3.x, this version requires that you SAVE the data
before exiting - it does not take place automatically like version 3.x, since
the data are viewed and manipulated in memory.

**********************
*** ABOUT SUBJECTS ***
**********************
This section of the program will take some adjustments to suite personal needs.
The section of the program that is of interest are lines 320, 630-700 and 2150-
2200.  These lines control the subject, so set them to match the kind of 
subjects in your library.  Of course, if there are not enough categories, you 
can always insert additional lines as necessary.  NOTE: the program is set up 
to use a 3 character long abbreviation for the subject, so you will want to plan
your subject abbreviations for that condition.  Press AID to view subjects and 
BEGIN to start the search.


**********************************
** AUTHOR AND SUBJECT SEARCHING **
**********************************
Use PROC'D to step through 'hits' in the search.  Press PROC'D until the cursor
re-appears or press BEGIN to start another search. Additionally, if you wish to
quit to the main menu while hit-stepping you may press BACK.  (Hit-stepping, of
course, is limited to these searches - as you may recall, the titles are all 
unique).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. If you decide to enter a first intial, your searches will have include the 
intial as well.
