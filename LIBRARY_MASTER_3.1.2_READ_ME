*** GENERAL INFORMATION ***
***************************
Thank you for taking a look at Library Master 3.1.2 for Extended Basic.  Library Master 3.1.2 can store 
over 500 titles with up to 3 authors per title on one disk (disk will include the program itself and the 
data file, LIBCAT, in RELATIVE,INTERNAL,FIXED 108 format).  
NOTE: It is good practice to make a note of last record number in the file. You may also find that there 
is enough disk space for more than 500 titles maximum, so adjust line 110 accordingly.

******************************
*** UPDATING THE DATA FILE ***
******************************
Upon selecting UPDATE DATA FILE (#4 in the menu), you will be prompted to enter a password.  The default 
password is, you guessed it, PASSWORD (see line 2540 to change that).  A password is there to provide 
some  "protection"  from  unwanted  or improperly entered records.   Updating  the data file is done by 
establishing a for-loop.  You then will be prompted to input the first record number to be entered, then 
the last record number to be entered (e.g. X to X for entering one record).  The program clears the 
screen and then input prompts are given for the information about the book:

AUTHOR #1(14): 
AUTHOR #2:
AUTHOR #3:
TITLE(39): 
SUBJECT(3): 
NOTES(9): 

Where the numbers in parentheses are the maximum number of characters allowed per entry.  You may choose 
to enter just the author's last name, or last name and first initialÂ¹.  For more on subjects, see that 
section of this READ ME.  NOTES section is a small field of 9 characters max length for additional notes.  
IMPORTANT: you cannot enter more than one title of the same name in the file, and will be prompted to 
enter a different title if a duplicate is found.  This provides protection from identical entries.
	
**********************
*** ABOUT SUBJECTS ***
**********************
This section of the program will take some adjustments to suite personal needs.  The section of the 
program that is of interest are lines 1780-1910, 1930-2050, 2160, and 2180.  These lines control the 
subject, so set them to match the kind of subjects in your library.  Of course, if there are not enough 
categories, you can always insert additional lines as necessary.  NOTE: the program is set up to use a 
3 character long abbreviation for the subject, so you will want to plan your subject abbreviations for 
that condition.  Press AID to view subjects and BEGIN to start the search.

*********************************************************
*** GENERAL SEARCHING:  BY AUTHOR, TITLE, AND SUBJECT ***
*********************************************************
Searching is fairly straight forward, with one little 'trick' involved.  Inputting a zero length string 
(i.e., simply hitting enter) for the ACCEPT AT *should* take you back to the CALL KEY so that you can 
press BACK to return to the main menu or DEL to clear the information window, but the process can be 
*slightly* touchy at times and you may need to press enter several times before the cursor disappears and 
the program returns to the CALL KEY.

**********************************
** AUTHOR AND SUBJECT SEARCHING **
**********************************
Use PROC'D to step through 'hits' in the search.  Press PROC'D until the cursor re-appears or press BEGIN 
to start another search. Additionally, if you wish to quit to the main menu while hit-stepping you may 
press BACK.  (Hit-stepping, of course, is limited to these searches - as you may recall, the titles are 
all unique).

1. If you decide to enter a first intial, your searches will have include the intial as well.
