# ti99-and-myarc-BASIC
TI-99/4A and Myarc (TI-99/4A succesor, Geneve) BASIC

A handful of programs, including a recently created gtksourceview file for TI-Extended BASIC (a pain in the ass that was, too).  

Anything in a zip file is in TIFILES format, so you'll need some way to use that.  MESS is a good emulator for TI-99/4a and Geneve, as is Classic99.
