# ti99-and-myarc-BASIC
TI-99/4A and Myarc (TI-99/4A succesor, Geneve) BASIC

A handful of programs, including a recently created gtksourceview file for 
TI-Extended BASIC (a pain in the ass that was, too).  

Anything in a zip file is in TIFILES format, so you'll need some way to use 
that.  MESS is a good emulator for TI-99/4a and Geneve.  The TIFILES will need 
to be put onto .dsk file before MESS will be able to use them (look up MESS for 
more information).   If you have a real TI-99/4A and RS232 you can send the raw 
TIFILES to your TI using something like 'moserial' on the PC and 'MagicFM', 
'Terminal Emulator-II', or 'TELCO' on the TI.  (All those methods have been 
tested, but 'Magic File Manipulator' is most reliable).
